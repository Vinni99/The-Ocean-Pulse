## Description

This project was the creation of a full stack website that utilizes specific technologies to render a workable and polished website that responds to a real world problem with a intuitive solution. <br>
The Website functionality allows a user to view API data on surfing locations thought the Bay Area and California. The website utilized express.js and Node.js to render the Routes functionality of the pages. It also utilizes sequelize and MYSQL to render the API created API information. Finally, the website utilized Bootstrap 5.3 and Handlebars to render the front end of the website. A user API as well as a surf locations API were created to allow the the use of databases through router.get and router.put aspects.

## Usage

As a User, I want to be able to view the most righteous surf spots on the "Best" Coast So that I can find the ultimate wave. I also want to let the World know about my sweet secret surf spot so that others can share those sick waves by posting my own surfing locations and having them put on the website.

## Installation

A user would first need to initialize the package.json file by entering <b>npm instal</b> in the terminal. This will add the required modules for the functionality of the website.<br>

Next the user would need to enter the provided seeds into the databases. This is done by entering <b>npm run seed</b> in the terminal. This will fill the created databases with the seeded information and allow for the user to log in and see provided surf locations.

## Usage
